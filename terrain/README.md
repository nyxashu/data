**ISPRS Comparison of Filters - 2003 Report Data**<br>
<br>

This dataset is made available to support the development and testing of PCL-based filters. <br>
<br>
The data originates from the 2003 report "ISPRS Comparison of Filters" and has been modified for this purpose. For detailed information on the original study and the data, please refer to the following resources:<br>

<br.
**Data Modifications**<br>
<br>
The dataset includes test data for eight sites, each of which has undergone the following modifications:<br>
<br>
**Projection**: All data has been reprojected into UTM Zone 32U.<br>
<br>
**Format Conversion:**<br>
<br>
Original data was converted from ASCII format to LAS.<br>
<br>
Subsequently, LAS files were converted to PCD format.<br.
<br>
**Note:** In the PCD version, there is no distinction between first and last returns.<br.
<br>
**Reference Datasets**<br>
<br>
For each site, two versions of the reference dataset are provided:

Complete Cloud: Contains all points.
Ground Returns Only: Includes only ground return points.
Both reference datasets have been similarly reprojected into UTM Zone 32U and converted from ASCII to LAS to PCD formats.
